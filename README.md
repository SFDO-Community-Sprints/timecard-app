### timecard-app
A timecard app for grant reporting

### Project Description
This app is designed to track hours that staff work on a grant. The hours are reported by Grant Work Items (i.e., tasks) which are then multiplied by the hourly rate of the staff member to calculate a total amount of the salaries/wages/benefits used. This amount can then be used to report back to the grant funder.

### Project Audience
Organizations who receive federal and state grants or any other grant that requires reporting of salaries/wages/benefits. Also, organizations that want to track hours worked on specific tasks within a grant.
